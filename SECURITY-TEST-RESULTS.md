# üîí OWASP Security Testing Results - COMPLETE EVIDENCE

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Project:** QA_Project (Planora Event Management System)
**Status:** ‚úÖ ALL SECURITY FIXES VERIFIED AND WORKING

---

## üìä EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**All 6 security tests PASSED** - Complete evidence that all 5 OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities have been successfully fixed and are working as designed.

### ‚úÖ VERIFICATION RESULTS
- **Rate Limiting:** ‚úÖ WORKING - Blocks brute force attacks after 5 attempts
- **NoSQL Injection:** ‚úÖ BLOCKED - MongoDB operators rejected
- **Public Read Access:** ‚úÖ WORKING - GET requests work without auth
- **Authentication Required:** ‚úÖ ENFORCED - Write operations require JWT tokens
- **Error Handler Safety:** ‚úÖ SECURE - No stack traces leaked
- **Password Validation:** ‚úÖ ENFORCED - Weak passwords rejected

---

## üß™ DETAILED TEST RESULTS

### TEST 1: RATE LIMITING (Brute Force Protection)
**Objective:** Verify rate limiter blocks excessive login attempts
**Endpoint:** POST /api/admin/login
**Expected:** Block after 5 attempts within 15 minutes

**‚úÖ RESULT: PASSED**
```
HTTP Status: 429 (Too Many Requests)
Response: "Too many login attempts from this IP, please try again after 15 minutes"
Evidence: Rate limiter correctly blocks 6th+ attempts
```

### TEST 2: NOSQL INJECTION PREVENTION
**Objective:** Verify MongoDB operator injection is blocked
**Endpoint:** POST /api/admin/login
**Payload:** `{"email":{"$ne":null},"password":"anything"}`

**‚úÖ RESULT: PASSED**
```
Response: "Attack Blocked!"
Evidence: Malicious MongoDB operators rejected by input validation
```

### TEST 3: PUBLIC READ ACCESS
**Objective:** Verify GET requests work without authentication
**Endpoint:** GET /api/events
**Expected:** HTTP 200 with event data

**‚úÖ RESULT: PASSED**
```
HTTP Status: 200
Success: True
Events Count: 1
Evidence: Public read access confirmed working
```

### TEST 4: AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED FOR WRITES
**Objective:** Verify POST/PUT/DELETE require authentication
**Endpoint:** POST /api/events
**Expected:** HTTP 401/403 without token

**‚úÖ RESULT: PASSED**
```
HTTP Status: 401 (Unauthorized)
Result: Write operation blocked without auth token
Evidence: Authentication middleware correctly enforces JWT requirement
```

### TEST 5: ERROR HANDLER SAFETY
**Objective:** Verify errors don't leak sensitive information
**Endpoint:** GET /api/invalid-endpoint
**Expected:** No stack traces in production

**‚úÖ RESULT: PASSED**
```
HTTP Status: 404 (NotFound)
Result: Error handled safely (no stack traces)
Evidence: Error handler protects sensitive server information
```

### TEST 6: PASSWORD VALIDATION
**Objective:** Verify password requirements are enforced
**Endpoint:** POST /api/admin/signup
**Payload:** `{"email":"test@example.com","password":"weak"}`

**‚úÖ RESULT: PASSED**
```
HTTP Status: 400 (BadRequest)
Result: Weak password rejected
Evidence: Password validation middleware working correctly
```

## üîß SECURITY CONTROLS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Rate Limiting (A07:2021 - Identification & Auth Failures)
- **Middleware:** `express-rate-limit`
- **Configuration:** 5 login attempts per 15 minutes
- **Status:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE AND WORKING

### 2. Input Validation (A03:2021 - Injection)
- **Library:** `express-validator`
- **Protection:** Email validation, escape(), trim()
- **Status:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE AND WORKING

### 3. Authentication (A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures)
- **Method:** JWT with Bearer tokens
- **Hashing:** bcrypt (10 rounds)
- **Status:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE AND WORKING

### 4. Authorization (A01:2021 - Broken Access Control)
- **Middleware:** `protect` function for write operations
- **Policy:** GET public, POST/PUT/DELETE require auth
- **Status:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE AND WORKING

### 5. Error Handling (A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures)
- **Handler:** Environment-aware error responses
- **Behavior:** Stack traces hidden in production
- **Status:** ‚úÖ ACTIVE AND WORKING
